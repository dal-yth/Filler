# Filler
42 school algorithm project.

##### Score 123/100

The goal of this project is to create a filler player. Filler is a two player game that consist of placing randomly created pieces on the gameboard with specific rules: 1. The piece must fit within the grid. 2. Exactly one square of the piece must overlap with the players on squares. 3. The piece may not be stacked on top of the enemy. 4. The game ends when a player is unable to place a piece on the board.

In essence filler is a game where you attempt to conquer as much territory as possible and make sure you always have available positions where to place the next piece. This makes it quite an interesting algorith challenge since the you can approach it in so many different ways. Perhaps your algorithm attempts to seal off half of the map and survive until the bitter end, perhaps you try to box your opponent in so they can't place any more pieces or maybe you try to breach into your opponents area and take over the area they were saving for late game.

### Features
-Pretty good filler player (even if I say so myself)
-Implementation of heat map
